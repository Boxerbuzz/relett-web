## Conclusion

Relett is a sophisticated property tokenization platform with a solid foundation. The core architecture is well-designed with comprehensive user management, property handling, and blockchain integration. However, several critical infrastructure pieces need completion, particularly around security (RLS policies), storage (file buckets), and real-time features. The platform is approximately 75% complete with most business logic implemented but lacking production-ready infrastructure and some integrations.
