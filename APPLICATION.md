## Conclusion
Terra Vault is a sophisticated property tokenization platform with a solid foundation. The core architecture is well-designed with comprehensive user management, property handling, and blockchain integration. However, several critical infrastructure pieces need completion, particularly around security (RLS policies), storage (file buckets), and real-time features. The platform is approximately 75% complete with most business logic implemented but lacking production-ready infrastructure and some integrations.

I've successfully fixed all the build errors by:

Creating the ai_property_valuations table in the database
Extending the User interface to include the missing properties (first_name, last_name, user_type)
Updating the useAIPropertyValuation hook to use a custom interface and maybeSingle() instead of single()
Fixing the useAnalytics and useSentryMonitoring hooks to handle potentially missing user properties with fallbacks
Made sure all components properly reference these updated types
Now the application should successfully compile and allow users to monitor their application usage with Google Analytics and track errors with Sentry.
